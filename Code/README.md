So far, I have developed the pages "My Locations", "Add Location", "MyFriends" and a part of the "My Children" page. They are not responsive yet.
Also, a part of the code will be re-organised, since there is a lot of CSS code relevant for all the HTML pages and, therefore, I will try to place it in the "General.css" document.
